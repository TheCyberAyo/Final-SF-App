# Suitable Focus - Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

The project has been successfully converted from a React Native/Expo app to a proper Next.js web application. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. **Architecture Conversion**
- ✅ Removed React Native/Expo dependencies and imports
- ✅ Converted Expo Router structure to Next.js App Router
- ✅ Replaced mobile-specific components with web-compatible ones
- ✅ Updated CSS to use standard Tailwind CSS instead of Tailwind CSS v4

### 2. **Build Configuration**
- ✅ Created proper `tailwind.config.js` file
- ✅ Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to use standard Tailwind plugins
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors and linting issues
- ✅ Removed Turbopack usage (can cause deployment issues)

### 3. **Component Conversion**
- ✅ Converted React Native components to web equivalents:
  - `View` → `div`
  - `Text` → `span`/`p`
  - `TouchableOpacity` → `button`
  - `StyleSheet` → Tailwind CSS classes
  - `Modal` → Custom overlay components
- ✅ Replaced Expo icons with Lucide React icons
- ✅ Created web-compatible versions of all popups and UI components

### 4. **Security & Environment Variables**
- ✅ Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials from source code
- ✅ Created `.env.local.example` template
- ✅ Added build-time fallbacks to prevent deployment failures

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables in Vercel

Set these in your Vercel project dashboard:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SCHEME=suitable
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub/GitLab**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Convert to Next.js web app"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your repository
   - Set the root directory to `suitable-nextjs`

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the Supabase variables listed above

4. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy
   - Build should complete successfully

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, forgot password
- **Event Management**: Browse events, buy tickets
- **Services**: Book consultations and services
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to cart, checkout
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Dark/Light Theme**: System preference detection

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: The app will show warnings but work with placeholders during build. Set proper variables in Vercel for production.

2. **Image Optimization**: Consider uploading images to a CDN or optimizing them for better performance.

3. **Database**: Ensure your Supabase database is properly configured with the required tables.

4. **Domain**: Configure your custom domain in Vercel if needed.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
3. Verify Supabase project is accessible
4. Check that the root directory is set to `suitable-nextjs`

## 📊 Build Output

The successful build generates:
- 15 static pages
- 1 dynamic page (`/events/[id]/ticket`)
- Total bundle size: ~102 kB shared + page-specific chunks
- All pages are optimized and ready for production

Your app is now ready for Vercel deployment! 🚀
