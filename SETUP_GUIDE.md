# 🚀 Suitable App - React Native Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the React Native frontend for your event booking and ticket management application.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- Expo CLI installed (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- Git installed

## 📱 React Native Frontend Setup

### 1. Navigate to React Native Directory
```bash
cd Suitable
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Expo Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

## 🔗 Current Application Flow

### Current Flow:
1. **Welcome Screen** → User clicks "Get Started"
2. **Authentication** → User signs up/logs in
3. **Landing Page** → User sees events with "Book Now" and "Buy Tickets" buttons
4. **Booking Flow** → User can book events and purchase tickets

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### React Native Frontend:
✅ Welcome screen with authentication flow  
✅ Landing page with event browsing  
✅ Category filtering  
✅ Featured events display  
✅ Booking and ticket buttons  
✅ Responsive design  

## 🔧 Configuration

### React Native Settings:
- Navigation: Expo Router with tab-based layout
- Styling: Responsive design with custom hooks
- Platform Support: iOS, Android, and Web

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Implement Missing Pages
Create the following pages that are referenced in the landing page:
- `/event/[id]` - Event details page
- `/booking/[id]` - Booking page
- `/tickets/[id]` - Ticket purchase page
- `/my-bookings` - User's bookings
- `/my-tickets` - User's tickets

### 2. Add Backend Integration
When you're ready to add a backend:
- Choose a backend solution (Firebase, Supabase, Node.js, etc.)
- Implement API endpoints for authentication, events, bookings
- Update the app to make real API calls instead of using mock data

### 3. Add Payment Integration
Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) for ticket purchases.

### 4. Push Notifications
Add push notifications for booking confirmations and event reminders.

### 5. Image Upload
Implement image upload for events and user profiles.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### React Native Issues:
- **Metro bundler issues**: Clear cache with `npx expo start --clear`
- **Navigation errors**: Ensure all referenced routes exist
- **Build issues**: Check that all dependencies are properly installed

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your React Native app is now ready to run! The landing page will show events with booking and ticket buying functionality, and users will be redirected there after logging in.

The app currently uses mock data for demonstration purposes. When you're ready to make it fully functional, you can integrate with a backend service of your choice.
